  bio: `I’m a data scientist focused on building practical ML systems for fintech and research. Recently, I worked at DRDO/INMAS on VR-driven CBRNe drone training scenarios using eye tracking, and at Kareai.io integrating LLM assistants into a Next.js product and automating data viz and reporting. My projects span ETL pipelines on GCP, OCR/YOLO-based perception, and LLM-powered analysis. I value clean experimentation, communication, and shipping work that actually gets used.`,
